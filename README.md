Analysis (25 points)
Selected few question example that was provided in the module and used the whole ( 5 files merge ) may's data ( selected samples out of whole may ) and tried to provide some discovery with in the data.

Hope what I provided bring in the brief detail of above requirements.

How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
Bar chart showed the total amount of ride was 150,000 but that is also because we pulled the whole may data with sample size and sum the five files with total 150,000.
Jugding by the data, you can not see the trend by date because there are many up and down trend through out the month. However, there is  a slight increased showed with the line chart prove a slight increase of rider by the end of the month.

What are the peak hourHow does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from).s when bikes are used during the summer months?
During the month of may, it seems like biker have the trend of riding in the morning around 8:00am and also later evening at the rush hour 17:00pm.

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?
Do to the size of the data, the rider id are well spread to many different location ( located with start location id), with that said we are able to identify the amount of people by using the size function with a larger circles collect on the map; However, it is hard to see what are the top 10 locations on the map.
